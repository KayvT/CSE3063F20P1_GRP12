Dear User,

In order to work with this software, you have to first install all of the software dependencies.

@user>$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Moreover, our team have fixed the problems in the answer key files, and in order to work with the
poll analyzer, you are required to use the provided answer keys.

Finally, we are also zipping and giving all of the outputs and data analysis we produced on a unix-
based machine. We believe that you should be able to produce the same outputs given that you installed
all requirements.

Regards,

Developers.
